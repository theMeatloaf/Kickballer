# Kickballer
A basic app to handle the kicking order for my kickball team...

We drink during the games so its hard to keep track of the kicking order with a clunky clipboard....hence this app

Written in Swift, no cocoapods or network required.  Uses basic NSUserDefault Serialization to save player list so it doesnt have to be entered each time the app is run
